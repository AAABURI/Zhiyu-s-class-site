  <p>
     Jiuweihu / Nine-tailed fox (九尾狐):
     Jiuweihu is a beast that lives in *Qingqiushan (青丘山). It looks like fox but has nine tails. Its sound is like crying of a baby. It will eat human but if people eat its meat, they can ward off evil.
     <br></br>
     Generally, Jiuweihu will gain additional tails as they grow older and more powerful, with a total of nine tails being the maximum number.
