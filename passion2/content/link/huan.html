  <p> The Huan (讙) is a cat-like creature in Chinese Mythology. It is one of the mythical beasts featured in the Chinese classic text Classic of Mountains and Seas (山海经).
      <br></br>
    The Huan resembles a cat with three tails and a single eye. It can mimic the sounds of other animals, described as sounding like a hundred sounds. It is said that it can ward off evil and people would keep them as pets for this reason. Eating its meat or wearing its skin is also said to cure jaundice.
