  <p> Gudiao (蛊雕): A Chinese mythical bird listed in the Southern Mountain Chapter of Shan Hai Jing, the Gudiao is similar to a condor but also noticeably different. It is horned, man-eating, and with an awful shriek like that of a human baby. In short, this is one mythological creature few people would want to meet.
