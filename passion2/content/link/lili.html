  <p> Lili（狸力）：A Lili is a mythical creature featured in the ancient bestiaries of China. The Lili was described as a pig that had forked feet of three claws much like that of a bird, which made the sound of a dog and was reported to live in the mountains. It was believed that seeing a Lili is a dark omen that meant an earthquake was soon to occur.
  <br></br>
A Lili could be an undiscovered species of wild pig that left the mountain as a safety precaution so that it may not be harmed. It is believed many species of animal possess the ability to predict natural disasters and this may be a the same case.
