      <h2>Dylan Thomas<br />︾</h2>
      <h3>Brief Introduction<br />︾<br />
        Dylan Marlais Thomas was born on October 27, 1914, in Swansea, South Wales. His father was an English Literature professor at the local grammar school and would often recite Shakespeare, fortifying Thomas's love for the rhythmic ballads of
        Gerard Manley Hopkins, W. B. Yeats, and Edgar Allan Poe.
        <br />    <br />
        In 1947 Thomas was awarded a Traveling Scholarship from the Society of Authors. He took his family to Italy, and while in Florence, he wrote In Country Sleep, And Other Poems (Dent, 1952), which includes his most famous poem, "Do not go
        gentle into that good night."
