    <h2>
      Do not go gentle into that good night,<div>
  Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<div>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<div>
  Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<div>
  Because their words had forked no lightning they
  Do not go gentle into that good night.<div>
  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
  Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<div>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<div>
  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<div>
  And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<div>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.<div>
  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
  Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<div>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<div>
  And you, my father, there on the sad height,<div>
  Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<div>
  Do not go gentle into that good night.<div>
  Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<div>
